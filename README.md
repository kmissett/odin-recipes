# odin-recipes

A recipe website, created as part of the Odin Project curriculum.

While this is all sort of review for me (as I've made several websites in the past, and have known the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript for something close to 20 years), it's nice to have some guidance as I push forward from these basic lessons into more advanced stuff. And, of course, it also lets me learn Git and GitHub better, which I've really never used before, aside from downloading some repositories as ZIP files in the past.
